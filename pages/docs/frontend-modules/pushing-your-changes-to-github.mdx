# Pushing your changes to GitHub

Once you’re done working on a feature or fix, you’ll want to push your changes to GitHub and file a PR. To do this, package your changes in a commit. We have guidelines for writing commit messages in our [contributing guide](https://o3-dev.docs.openmrs.org/#/getting_started/contributing).

Creating a commit should trigger some pre-commit hooks. Typically, part of the work these hooks do involves running `yarn run extract-translations`. This task fires up `turborepo` and runs the `extract-translations` task in each package in the monorepo. This task extracts translation keys and strings and updates the default locale’s translations file, `en.json` in the `translations` directory of your frontend module. This is useful for internationalisation. After the pre-commit hooks run, you then want to push your changes to GitHub. Doing so will trigger a `pre-push` hook that will typically run the following tasks in parallel using `turborepo`:

- `typescript` - checks your application’s types.
- `lint` - runs a lint check using Prettier.
- `test` - runs tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

If any of these tasks fail, the push should fail. Once the push succeeds, you can go to the GitHub repo related to your package and file a pull request.
