Our module loading system is based on Webpack Module Federation.
We have a "dynamic remote containers" system. The "entry point" of
the application is `@openmrs-esm-app-shell`. The list of remotes
to be loaded is supplied in import maps. Our import maps are not
processed by the browser or SystemJS, but are used internally to
resolve module names to URLs.
 
Each module ("remote") is provided as a name and URL. For each URL,
a `<script>` element is appended to the DOM. Because those scripts have webpack
library type == 'var', when they are loaded, they create a new
global variable which has the Webpack Container Interface for that
module: the `init` and `get` methods. We use those to obtain the
ctual module exports.
