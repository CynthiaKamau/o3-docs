# Introduction

So, what is O3? O3, alternately referred to as O3 and OpenMRS 3.x, is a new frontend framework for OpenMRS that leverages modern frontend technologies with the goal of being used across as many organizations as possible.

## Guiding principles

The guiding principles behind O3 include:

- **Code reuse** and **reduction of duplicated effort**
- **Modular architecture** - allows for easy addition, removal, or updating of modules to extend functionality or tailor the system to specific needs.
- **Configuration-first** - each frontend module can specify itâ€™s config properties
- **Usability** - optimized UI for point of care, responsiveness, and patient care records that can be simple or very complex
- **Enhanced UI** - more intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing UI
- ** Modern technologies** - greater appeal to the global talent pool of developers
- **Improved interoperability**

## Tech stack

O3 leverages the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) - sdds type safety to JavaScript
- [Carbon design system](https://carbondesignsystem.com) - design system from IBM.
- [Single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org) - JavaScript router for frontend microservices
- Backend APIs - combination of the [OpenMRS REST API](https://rest.openmrs.org) and the FHIR API.
