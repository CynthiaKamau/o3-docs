# The core framework

The O3 framework gets packaged as a JavaScript library in the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openmrs/esm-framework). It aggregates all the core libraries for the OpenMRS 3.0 application. These libraries handle the following concerns:

- Shared utilities
- Global state management
- Functions that enable offline mode
- Global events, variables and utilities
- Configuration system
- API Documentation
- OpenMRS API functions
- Breadcrumbs navigation
- Extension system
- Global error handling
