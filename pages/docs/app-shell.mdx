# The app shell

The app shell forms the base of the application. It coordinates and sets up everything in the application. It lives inside of the [esm-core](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core) monorepo.

Presently, O3 utilizes a hybrid frontend module loading strategy. All of our frontend modules get loaded using Webpack module federation, with the exception of the Angular form engine (which gets loaded using System.js). Work is underway to move all of our module loading to the module federation strategy. When the application gets initialized, the app shell:

- Evaluates stylesheets and scripts
- Sets up the breadcrumbs navigation menu
- Configures the SPA application
- Installs the service worker
- Loads and evaluates the different frontend modules from the import map
- Loads and validates the provided configurations
- Sets up offline capabilities and synchronization features
- Sets up internationalization using react-i18next
- Wires up route paths
- Sets up application lifecycles using single-spa.
- Renders the UI
