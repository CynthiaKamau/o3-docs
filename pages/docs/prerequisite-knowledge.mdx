# Prerequisite knowledge

Before developing on O3, you should be familiar with the following technologies:

## JavaScript

Knowing JavaScript is prerequisite to everything else. We recommend going through the following resources:

- [Introduction to JavaScript - Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [JavaScript to know for React - Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

## JavaScript tooling

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - we primarily use Yarn as our package manager. If the repository you're looking at has a `yarn.lock` file at its root, then it uses Yarn.
- [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) - we use `lerna` to manage our monorepos.
- [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo) - we use `turbo` to run scripts during both local development and in our continuous integration processes.
- [swc](https://swc.rs/) - we use SWC to compile our code into a format supported by all major browsers.

## TypeScript

Most of our code is written in TypeScript. Get started learning TypeScript [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

## React

The [official docs](https://react.dev/) are a great way to get acquainted with React. Don't gloss over the fundamentals. Having a solid understanding of its core concepts is imperative in enabling you to learn how to develop high-quality frontend modules in O3.

## Git

It is imperative that you keep your code in a version control system. OpenMRS uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/). You should know the basics of using Git and GitHub. Great learning resources include:

- Learn [Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- [Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
