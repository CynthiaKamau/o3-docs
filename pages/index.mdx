## OpenMRS 3.0 Frontend developer documentation

This documentation is intended to enable developers to develop and deploy custom UI features for OpenMRS.

Visit the [Wiki page](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+3.0%3A+A+Frontend+Framework+that+enables+collaboration+and+better+User+Experience) if you havenâ€™t already. It provides a high-level introduction to the project and all of the relevant links.

You should first read the [Implementer Documentation](https://wiki.openmrs.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=224527013), which provides some conceptual orientation as well as instructions for deployment and configuring.
